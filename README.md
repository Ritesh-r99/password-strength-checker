# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

The **Password Strength Checker** is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords and provide feedback on improving security. By analyzing key aspects such as length, use of various character types, and pattern complexity, this tool helps users create robust passwords that are harder to guess or crack. It is a valuable resource for developers, security professionals, or everyday users looking to enhance their password hygiene.

## Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**: The tool assesses password strength based on key factors such as length, complexity, and variety of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides specific recommendations on how to improve the password's security (e.g., increasing length, adding special characters).
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Passwords are assigned a score based on their strength, giving users an immediate understanding of password quality.
- **Customizable Rules**: The tool allows for customization of the password strength criteria, making it adaptable to different security standards.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use command line interface for entering passwords and receiving feedback.
- **Password History Check (optional)**: Detects if the entered password has been part of any previous data breaches (via external APIs or local datasets).
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Runs on any system that supports Python, ensuring broad accessibility.

## Password Strength Criteria

The strength of a password is determined based on the following factors:

- **Length**: Longer passwords are more difficult to crack.
- **Character Variety**: Use of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Pattern Detection**: Avoidance of common patterns, sequences (e.g., "1234", "password"), and dictionary words.
- **Uniqueness**: Ensures that the password has not been previously used or compromised in known breaches.
  
The tool assigns scores based on these factors and provides feedback such as:

- Weak Password: Too short, predictable, or lacking complexity.
- Moderate Password: Meets minimum length and complexity but could be improved.
- Strong Password: Meets all criteria for a secure password.


## How It Works

1. **Password Input**: The user inputs a password via the command line interface.
2. **Evaluation**: 
   - The tool evaluates the password based on length, character variety, and complexity.
   - It checks for common patterns and provides a strength score.
3. **Feedback**: The tool outputs a detailed report, including the password strength rating and suggestions for improvement if necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (if applicable):
  - `re` for regular expression analysis
  - `argparse` for command line parsing

You can install any additional dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritesh-r99/password-strength-checker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd password-strength-checker
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Checking Password Strength

```bash
python password-strength-checker.py --password <your_password>
```

### Example:

```bash
python password-strength-checker.py --password P@ssw0rd123!
```

The tool will return an evaluation such as:

- **Strength**: Strong
- **Score**: 85/100
- **Feedback**: Your password is strong, but could be improved by using additional special characters.
